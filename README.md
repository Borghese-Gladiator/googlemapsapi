# googlemapsapi
On the following code you  ll see how to develop a Google Map with Google Map Javascript API.
The map includes multiple markers, info windows, custom markers and layers.
To get all the coordinates I used the Google Geo Coding API and looped it with python.
More informations you can find under the following URL: XXX MEDIUM!!

The map is written in JavaScript.
